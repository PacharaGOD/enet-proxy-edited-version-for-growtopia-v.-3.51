## How to use
* Does not need separate http server
* Use HxD or similar to edit "growtopia1.com" and "growtopia2.com" to "localhost" In growtopia binary.
* Alternative: Use hosts file to set growtopia1 and growtopia2 to point to 127.0.0.1 if you want to
* Start proxy -> Run localhost patched file (or normal with hosts) -> Works as supposed
